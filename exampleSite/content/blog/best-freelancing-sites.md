In addition, memberships are free. More importantly, members can quickly find gigs and get paid.

### 4. ProBlogger

Darren Rowse launched ProBlogger in 2004 I would consider ProBlogger a site created by the people for the people. The developer of ProBlogger put more of a personal touch on this company, unlike other sites in this marketplace. Mr. Rowse launched this platform based on his experience. His aim was to help marketers, whereas groups of developers developed other sites in this marketplace for profit maximization. ProBlogger is the cheapest site to hire freelancers. You can purchase services as low as $70.

### 5. The Writer Finder

The Writer Finder might be the most expensive, but they deliver skilled on-demand workers within 72 hours. If you don't agree, you can get your money back. How does it work? You have two options of service to choose between. The first option is to pay whenever you want services. This option doesnâ€™t lock you into a contract or subscription. The second option is to pay for a plan. There are two plans you can purchase. The first plan is the dedicated account manager plan, which costs $2,500. The second plan is the dedicated Sr account manager, which costs $10,000. However, The Writer Finder specializes in connecting publishers with customers.

### 6. Upwork

Upwork ranks number one in its respective markets. Annually, Upwork generates an estimated revenue of more than $1 billion, posting over three million jobs from 5 million registered customers. Over the years, the company has re-branded and merged to become one of the most dominant forces in its field, beginning in 1998. In the beginning, Elance was the name of this organization. In 2003, they renamed the company oDesk. Ten years later (2013), the organization's brand name changed to oDesk-Elance. In 2015, the company re-branded its name to Upwork. I have not used this platform, but according to positive reviews and satisfied clients, the company is legitimate.
